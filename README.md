# ITMO Physix; Task after lecture 4

## Simulation of an electric generator: rotation of a circuit in a magnetic field

Variant I

Input parameters: magnetic field strength, rotation speed, circuit resistance.

Final view of the model: Graphs of EMF and induced current versus time. The graphs change as the parameters change.
